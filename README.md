# Blocksy Child Theme - Development Repository

## üåü Version Control and Development Workflow

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Blocksy Child Theme! This repo isn‚Äôt just code‚Äîit‚Äôs my central hub for tracking every tweak, experiment, and improvement I make in developing the theme.

### Why GitHub?

Even though the live site is hosted on Kinsta, GitHub helps me:  

- Keep a clean, chronological history of all code changes  
- Experiment safely without affecting the live site  
- Maintain a reliable backup of my WordPress theme  
- Track and revert changes whenever needed  

### Local Development with DevKinsta

I develop locally using **DevKinsta**, which allows me to spin up a complete WordPress environment on my computer. Once changes are finalized locally:  

1. I commit and push them to GitHub for version control.  
2. I manually update the live website hosted on **Kinsta**.  

This workflow has key benefits:  

- üîí **Safe Experimentation:** Test new features locally without risking the live site  
- üìö **Comprehensive History:** Every change is recorded and reversible  
- üöÄ **Flexible Development:** Easy to manage complex theme customizations before deployment
